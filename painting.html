<p>I first encountered painting in elementary school and I dabbled with it over time and spent time learning and viewing different art through college. Initially when I first started learning how to paint I had taken a lot of time to experiment with color theory, understanding the chemistry of the paint I was working with to understand what would blend well together and what wouln't to give the most vibrant colorations. So far in my painting journey I've discovered my favorite painting medium is acrylic, my second choice in paints would be oil, and my third choice would be watercolor. What I enjoy most about Acrylic is that it's acessible dries quickly, can be easy to mix, and can be layered well. When it comes to oil paints you can build layers upon layers to create some of the most detailed and intricate patintings there is that can last many many years. The reason why oils isn't quite my favorite but still made my top three is because it can be given dimension and built upon and goes well in some compositions with acrylic paint, while I also like it I also dislike it because some of the materials in oil painting can be carcinogenic. I enjoy watercolor painting it can be layered and done in many beautiful ways, but like oil paint it comes with it's own quirks and sets of rules once completed water color compostions must be given the right conditions and framing, if not protected by a frame often times the composition could get ruined easily by any type of moisture so it's great to take the appropriate measures to keep it protected and presentable.</p>
